# IOIMG
An Image encoder decoder system for storing data

This system is very rudimentary and not designed to be used in steganography but rather as a proof of concept where save data files can be stored as images rather than individual files so they can be transfered between devices with ease.

This system still needs development but is functional in it's current state.
